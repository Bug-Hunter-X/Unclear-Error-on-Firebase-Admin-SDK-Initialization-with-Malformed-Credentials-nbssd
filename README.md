This example demonstrates a common yet frustrating error when initializing the Firebase Admin SDK: unclear error messages resulting from problems with the service account credentials JSON file. The `malformedCredentials.js` file showcases a common mistake (missing a field), and `fixedCredentials.js` demonstrates the correct configuration.  Ensure your credentials file is properly structured to avoid these initialization failures.  Refer to the Firebase documentation for the exact required fields and format of your credentials.
